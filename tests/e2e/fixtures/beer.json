    "description": "A draft-only exclusive beer for International markets as part of the DogDealers programme. Karma Cloud is a tropical IPA, designed to cram as much fruit flavour in as possible using only hops to recreate those flavours.",
    "food_pairing": [ "Roasted pork loin with tropical fruit", "Nachos", "Cheddar cheese board"],
    "brewers_tips": " Using the latest year's hops is a must. Leave the beer conditioning on the hops for a maximum of 5 days, otherwise there is a risk of a green vegetal like character being extracted."
